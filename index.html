    <p>
      My name is Brandon Bennitt and I grew up in the southwest suburbs of
      Chicago in Mokena, IL. Currently, I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering
      student with a passion for all types of technologies and innovation. When
      I'm not studying for school, you can find me either on the baseball field,
      in the gym, or spending time with my friends and family. I have played
      baseball since I was young and continue to play on the Varsity Baseball
      team at IIT as the starting second baseman. I also have a passion for
      exerising and lifting weights. I think that exercising and weight lifting
      almost every morning helps anchor my day and gets me motivated for the
      rest of my day. When I get a chance to step away from other
      responsibilities in my life, I like to spend time relaxing with my friends
      and family.

    <p>
      Although I have experimented with many different technologies, I do not
      have any experience with web-development. I decided to take this class to
      learn how to create and design websites for my personal interests and
      career development. I think that it's a great idea for any technologist to
      learn as many different technologies as they can, especially while still
      in school. By the end of this class, I hope to be able to create a website
      that serves as a professional portfolio for myself. I intend to create
      different tabs on my website that will include different projects that I
      have completed during my courses and my free time, so potential employers
      can really see what kind of skills I possess.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a 2nd year Computer Engineering student, I am still exploring different
      paths that I can go down for the rest of my time at IIT. Some of my
      interests that I would like to learn more about are cyber security,
      software development, statistical analysis, and financial markets. In the
      next few years, I plan to fill electives with classes that study these
      topics, and hopefully I will be able to find a path that combines multiple
      personal interests to pursue a co-terminal degree that focuses on what I
      would like to pursue for a career. Besides coursework, I hope to get an
      internship opportunity in the summer of 2020 where I will be able to
      expand my skills and apply what I have learned in the classroom to work on
      different projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      After my time at IIT is over, I am looking into working as a data
      scientist, software developer, or cyber security engineer. Even though
      these roles all require different skills, I hope to learn as much about
      technology as I can while I'm still at IIT and find my passion that I want
      to spend the rest of my life working on.
