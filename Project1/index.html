    <h1>Brandon Bennitt: Background and Ambitions</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Brandon Bennitt and I grew up in the southwest suburbs of Chicago in Mokena, IL. Currently, I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering student with a passion for all types of technologies and innovation. When I'm not studying for school, you can find me either on the baseball field, in the gym, or tinkering with technologies that I have read about. I have played baseball since I was young and continue to play on the Varsity Basebll team at IIT as the starting second baseman. I also have a passion for exerising and lifting weights. I think that exercising and weight lifting almost every morning helps anchor my day and gets me motivated for the rest of my day. When I get chance to step away from other responsibilities in my life, I like to spend time relaxing with my friends and family.
