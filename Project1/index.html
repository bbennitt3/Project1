    <p>
      My name is Brandon Bennitt and I grew up in the southwest suburbs of Chicago in Mokena, IL. Currently, I'm a 2nd year Computer Engineering student with a passion for all types of technologies and innovation. When I'm not studying for school, you can find me either on the baseball field, in the gym, or spending time with my friends and family. I have played baseball since I was young and continue to play on the Varsity Basebll team at IIT as the starting second baseman. I also have a passion for exerising and lifting weights. I think that exercising and weight lifting almost every morning helps anchor my day and gets me motivated for the rest of my day. When I get a chance to step away from other responsibilities in my life, I like to spend time relaxing with my friends and family.

      Although I have experimented with many different technologies, I do not have any experience with web-development. I decided to take this class to learn how to create and design websites for my personal interests and career development. I think that it's a great idea for any technologist to learn as many different technologies as they can, especially while still in school. By the end of this class, I hope to be able to create a website that serves as a professional portfolio for myself. I intend to create different tabs on my website that will include different projects that I have completed during my courses and my free time so potential emplyers can really see what kind of skills I possess.

      As a 2nd year Computer Engineering student, I am still exploring different paths that I can go down for the rest of my time at IIT. Some of my interests that I would like to learn more about are cyber security, software development, statistical analysis, and financial markets. In the next few years, I plan to fill electives with classes that study these topics, and hopefully I will be able to find a path that combines multiple personal interests to pursue a co-terminal degree that focuses on what I would like to pursue for a career. Besides coursework, I hope to get an internship opportunity in the summer of 2020 where I will be able to expand my skills and apply what I have learned in the classroom to work on different projects.

      After my time at IIT is over, I am looking into working as a data scientist, software developer, or cyber security engineer. Even though these roles all require different skills, I hope to learn as much about technology as I can while I'm still at IIT and find my passion that I want to spend the rest of my life working on.
